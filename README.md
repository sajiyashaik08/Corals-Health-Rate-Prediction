# Corals-Health-Rate-Prediction
Corals Health Rate Prediction is a data-driven initiative aimed at assessing and forecasting the health of coral reefs using environmental indicators and machine learning techniques. Coral reefs are vital ecosystems that support marine biodiversity, but they are increasingly threatened by climate change, pollution, and disease.
